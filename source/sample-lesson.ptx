    <introduction>
        <p>This section contains a lesson from Prof. Atchison's MATH123 course. 
    It was originally written in LaTeX and has been converted to PreTeXt as an exercise. </p>

    <subsection xml:id="linear-objective">
        <title>Objective:</title>
        <p> Solve, graph, and give interval notation for the solution to a linear inequality. Create a sign diagram to identify those intervals where a linear expression is positive or negative.</p>

        <title>Students will be able to:</title>
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Solve a linear inequality by isolating the variable.</li>
            <li>Recognize the need to change the direction of an inequality when multiplying or dividing by a negative value.</li>
            <li>Graph a linear inequality on a one-dimensional axis.</li>
            <li>Express solutions using interval notation.</li>
